# Example Site

This is a nice, little example site, showing how the CMS will work. I rather enjoy it, tbh. It's elegant, simple, and
should let people do whatever the hell they want to, with it.

We can also put a table in here:

| Things | Stuff |
|:------:|:-----:|
|   20   |   3   |
|   54   |   4   |
|   9    | 9999  |

After that, there's not much else to worry about.

## Are we sure?

**Yup.** Our best friend says so:

<div>
    <img src="../static/images/best_friend.png" title="My Best Friend" width="125">
    <div style="width: 125px; text-align: center">
        <small><i>"Howdy."</i></small>
    </div>
</div>
